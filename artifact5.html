  <h1>Artifact 5: AI & Education – What's New?</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Newsletter | August 2025</strong></p>
  <p>This month, I pulled together the most important updates about how AI is changing education right now. These short stories show how schools, companies, and governments are moving quickly to bring AI into classrooms—and how we as educators and leaders need to keep up.</p>

  <h2>🚀 1. AWS Launches AI Education Program in Australia</h2>
  <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is working with Code for Schools to help one million students learn AI skills in the next 3 years. They will also train teachers and families to use AI in safe, fair ways. This effort is part of a $20B global tech education push.</p>

  <h2>🧠 2. Claude AI Adds “Learning Modes” to Support Student Thinking</h2>
  <p>The AI tool Claude (by Anthropic) launched new modes like “Socratic learning” and “think-aloud.” These features help students build understanding instead of just getting answers. This move shows that AI can support deeper thinking when used well.</p>

  <h2>🏫 3. AI Becomes Part of the Plan at U.S. Colleges</h2>
  <p>Schools like Barnard, Columbia, NYU, and MIT are now using tools like Gemini in classes. Students are encouraged to try AI in guided ways, showing how higher education is making AI part of day-to-day learning—not just a tech add-on.</p>

  <h2>🌎 4. California Pushes AI Learning Statewide</h2>
  <p>California is building a free AI education program for all public school students. The goal: teach students how to use AI tools safely and smartly. Some experts worry about misuse, but the plan is backed by industry and education leaders alike.</p>

  <h2>📋 5. Miami-Dade School District Shifts from Blocking AI to Setting Rules</h2>
  <p>Miami-Dade Public Schools used to block AI tools like Gemini. Now they’re creating clear rules for how students and teachers can use them. This reflects a bigger shift: schools are starting to manage AI use instead of avoiding it.</p>

  <h2>💼 6. $1B Investment Expands AI Learning at Arden University (UK)</h2>
  <p>Investor Marcelo Claure led a deal to buy half of Arden University. Their plan: use AI to translate courses into over 150 languages and expand access to learning around the world. This shows how AI is also changing global higher education.</p>

  <h2>🔍 Reflection</h2>
  <p>This newsletter-style artifact helps me stay current with what’s happening in AI and education. Writing it helped me practice turning fast, complex news into clear, simple stories that others can understand. It also showed me how fast AI is moving—from tools to rules to whole-school shifts.</p>

  <p><strong>Customization for Audience:</strong> I wrote for anyone visiting this site—families, teachers, school leaders—using everyday words and real-life updates. I kept each update short and clear, with helpful headlines.</p>

  <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> AI is not just a tool—it’s becoming a regular part of education. The speed of change means we need to keep learning and sharing.</p>

  <p><strong>Feedback and Revisions:</strong> A peer suggested I turn my notes into a newsletter format. That helped make the artifact more fun to read and easier to follow. I also trimmed the text and used icons to guide the eye.</p>

  <p><strong>Value:</strong> This shows my ability to research, write, and share updates clearly. It also shows how I bring an educator’s lens to AI change—helping others understand what matters most.</p>
