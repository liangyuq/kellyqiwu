  <h1>Artifact 2: Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Real Life</h1>

  <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This artifact shares two real-world examples from schools. One uses deep learning to help students understand lessons in their own language. The other uses a simple machine learning model to keep school emails free of spam.</p>

  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To show how both simple and deep models can solve real problems when used in the right way. This helps school leaders and teachers choose tools that match their needs.</p>

  <p><strong>Process:</strong> I wrote both examples after studying how machine learning and deep learning work. I focused on writing in plain, clear language for school-based readers.</p>

  <p><strong>Tools/Technologies Used:</strong> Writing, research, peer feedback, and basic knowledge of ML and DL methods.</p>

  <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> This artifact shows my ability to explain technical ideas in simple terms, making the information useful for teachers, staff, and anyone interested in how AI works in real life. It reflects my strengths in communication and instructional thinking.</p>

    <h3>Deep Learning Example</h3>
    <p>In many schools today, teachers use a translation tool to help students learn new ideas in their own language. For example, a class in math or science may use an app that turns English texts into Spanish as students read. This tool can show each student a clear version of the lesson in the language they know best. In this way, every child can follow the same lesson with less worry about words they do not know.</p>

    <p>Deep learning models like RNNs or Transformer networks work well for this task because they learn how words fit together in a sentence. These models look at all the words before and after each word. They learn patterns of language. When a student’s app sees a new sentence, the model can guess the best match in the other language by using its wide view of the text. This helps it make smoother and more true to life translations. The model also learns from many examples over time, which makes it better with new or odd phrases.</p>

    <p>A simple machine learning method often treats each word or pair of words on its own. It might look at a list of common word swaps or short phrases. This method may miss the meaning that comes from the whole sentence or the idea in the whole paragraph. When context is lost, the result can be confusing or wrong. In a lesson, this could lead to key ideas being missed or twisted. That is why a deep learning model is a much better choice for turning one language into another in real time for students.</p>

    <h3>Simple Machine Learning Example</h3>
    <p>In many schools today, teachers and staff share information by email. A simple spam filter can help keep these emails clear. For example, a school district can use a model that looks for words like “free,” “win,” or “click” to mark an email as spam. The model learns from examples of past emails that are marked spam or not spam. Once it is learned, it can sort new emails so that important messages reach the right person and junk mail goes away.</p>

    <p>This approach works well because it uses a small set of clear rules. The model only needs to check things like how often certain words appear or if a message has many links. It can also look at the sender’s address. With these simple checks, the model can make a good guess about each email. It runs fast and does not need a lot of computer power. Schools often do not have big budgets or fancy servers, so this method is easy to use.</p>

    <p>A deep learning model would be too much for this task. Deep learning needs a lot of data to learn well. It also takes more time and strong computers to train. In addition, it can be hard to see why the model made a choice. In a school setting, staff need to know why an email was marked spam. With a simple model, they can read the rules and make changes by hand. This keeps the system clear and easy to manage.</p>
