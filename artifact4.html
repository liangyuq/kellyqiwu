  <h1>Artifact 4: Leading with Care – Reducing Bias in AI for Schools</h1>

  <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In this artifact, I share a personal value statement about the role of human bias in AI and machine learning. I focus on what it means to lead in elementary education while using these tools. I also offer real steps schools can take to reduce bias and help all students feel seen, safe, and supported.</p>

  <h2>My Personal Value Statement</h2>
  <p>I believe that using AI in schools should never harm or leave anyone out. As a leader in elementary education, I value fairness, care, and clear thinking. I know that human bias can show up in data, in tools, and in decisions—even when we don’t mean for it to happen. My goal is to help children learn and grow without being judged unfairly by systems that don’t fully know them. I will speak up, slow down, and ask better questions when using new tools. I believe every child’s story matters, and no child should be misjudged by a model trained on someone else’s world.</p>

  <h2>Field-Specific Strategies to Reduce Bias</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ask Who Is Missing:</strong> Before using an AI tool, ask if the data includes children from all backgrounds—race, language, income, ability. If not, push for better data or don’t use the tool yet.</li>

    <li><strong>Choose Tools with Care:</strong> Don’t just pick tools because they’re popular. Ask how they were built. Ask if teachers, families, and students had a voice in the process.</li>

    <li><strong>Test the Tool in Real Classrooms:</strong> Try new tools in a small group first. Look for signs of harm or unfair results. Use real examples from your own school, not just what the company gave you.</li>

    <li><strong>Teach Kids About AI:</strong> Help students understand that not all answers from a computer are right or fair. Teach them to ask questions and to speak up if something feels wrong.</li>

    <li><strong>Use People, Not Just Numbers:</strong> AI can help, but it cannot replace the care of a teacher. Use AI as one voice—not the final voice—when making choices for kids.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>This artifact matters to me because it brings together my love for education and my care for fairness. As someone who works with data and learning tools, I know that bias doesn’t go away just because a system looks smart. It is my job to lead with care, question easy answers, and build systems that work for all children—not just the ones who fit the data best.</p>

  <p><strong>Value:</strong> This artifact shows my thinking as a leader. It reflects my values, my voice, and my plans for using AI in a way that keeps kids at the center. It also shows that I know how to turn ideas into action in schools.</p>
